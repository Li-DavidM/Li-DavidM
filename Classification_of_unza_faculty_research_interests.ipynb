        "The University of Zambia (UNZA) produces numerous research publications annually across diverse faculties. However, these publications are not systematically classified according to Zambiaâ€™s Vision 2030 sector categories, making it challenging for policymakers, funding bodies, and administrators to assess how research aligns with national development priorities. Manual classification is time-consuming, inconsistent, and inefficient. There is a need for an automated system to classify research outputs into Vision 2030 sectors using only publication titles."
